function varargout = q1GUI(varargin)
% Q1GUI MATLAB code for q1GUI.fig
%      Q1GUI, by itself, creates a new Q1GUI or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = Q1GUI returns the handle to a new Q1GUI or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      Q1GUI('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in Q1GUI.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      Q1GUI('Property','Value',...) creates a new Q1GUI or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before q1GUI_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to q1GUI_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
